# need to be in qmk folder
cd ~/qmk_firmware/

# for white keyboard
make splitkb/kyria/rev1:FatjonZogaj:avrdude

# for OLED one
qmk compile -kb splitkb/kyria/rev1 -km FatjonZogaj 
qmk flash -kb splitkb/kyria/rev1 -km FatjonZogaj -bl dfu

NOTE: simply calling qmk compile or qmk flash does not seem to work!
It uses kyria/rev2 instead of kyria/rev1 for some reason, even if it is defined through qmk config
